Ideas on how reduction of cost and emissions can improve application performance and developer joy.

## Abstract

The IT sector is one of the top COâ‚‚ emitters, but as developers, we have the power to reduce the footprint of the software that we build. The good news is that many of the ways to do that, can also save you a bunch of money! It's a win-win!

Even better: this opens up fun rabbit holes for us to dive into. How small are your Docker containers? Can you make them even smaller? How fast is the web framework that you use? Can you make it even faster? What's your application's uptime? Can you make that even lower? ... wait what?

In this talk, I'll explain why emitting COâ‚‚ is a problem, how the IT sector contributes to it (and does other things that are bad for the climate), and share some tips to save you (or, let's be honest: your employer) money and cut down emissions at the same time. Not because you have to, but because it's fun.
