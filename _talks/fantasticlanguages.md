A fast-paced overview of a lot of different programming languages, intended to entertain and perhaps even change a mind or two.

## Abstract

PHP sucks! C# is just a Java rip-off! Kotlin is better than Java! English is just weird!

Wrong.

Every language is cool and unique in its own way and will influence the way you see and use your own favourite language. Put aside your preconceptions, and let me show you what I have learned from working with Java, Ruby, Elm, and yes: even PHP.
