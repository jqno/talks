How to write a good `equals` method, and to test it with [EqualsVerifier](http://jqno.nl/equalsverifier).

## Abstract
Did you know your equals method can contain bugs, even if you have it generated by your IDE?

As the creator of EqualsVerifier, I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly. I will show you how to recognise potential bugs in equals(), and why you should care about them. You will see how to craft an ironclad equals method. Also, you will see how to test your equals method and gain 100% coverage with a single line of test code, using EqualsVerifier. Because testing equals shouldnâ€™t have to take pages of code.
