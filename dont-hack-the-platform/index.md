title: "Don't hack the platform? ‚ò†Ô∏èüí£üí•"
---
A funny anthology of tricks and hacks for the JVM. Voted 2018‚Äôs ["best non-Venkat talk"](https://nljug.org/nieuws/j-fall-2018-the-top-10-sessions/) by the J-Fall audience! 

## Abstract
Don‚Äôt go to this talk! Your coworkers will not be happy when you come back to work tomorrow and start applying the things you‚Äôll learn here. You‚Äôll do a lot of damage.

Mutating immutable objects is never a good idea. You shouldn‚Äôt be bypassing the constructor when you instantiate an object. You certainly don‚Äôt need to add constants to your enums at runtime. And don‚Äôt even think about including Java 8 code in your Java 7 codebase. Truly, nothing good will come from attending this talk.

In all seriousness, this talk will provide awareness about some of the lesser-known vulnerabilities of Java and the JVM. Maybe I‚Äôll even tell you how to guard against them.

## Show me the code!
