    /*
     * Summary:
     *
     * - Make sure you follow the contracts.
     *
     * - Use final:
     *   - use it on fields.
     *   - use it on methods.
     *   - use it on classes.
     *   - use it on ALL THE THINGS.
     *   - final should be your default; deviate ONLY when necessary.
     *   - this is your mantra.
     *
     * - Use instanceof, not getClass().
     *
     * - If you can't avoid adding state to subclasses, use canEqual.
     *
     * - EqualsVerifier helps you find problems.
