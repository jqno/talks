	 * Summary:
	 * 
	 * - Make sure you follow the contracts.
	 * 
	 * - Use final:
	 *   - use it on fields.
	 *   - use it on methods.
	 *   - use it on classes.
	 *   - use it EVERYWHERE.
	 *   - final should be your default.
	 *   - this is your mantra.
	 * 
	 * - Use instanceof, not getClass().
	 * 
	 * - If you can't avoid adding state to subclasses, use canEqual.
	 * 
	 * - EqualsVerifier helps you find problems.
