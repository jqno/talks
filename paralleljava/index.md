title: "Java from a Parallel Universe"
---
What Java would look like in a world where annotations were never invented. 

## Abstract
Do you get excited about Java when you’re at a conference, learning about cool new features and tools to try?<br/>
Do you get sad the next day, when you’re back at work building enterprise applications in an ancient version of Java?

You’re not alone.

In this talk, we will explore what Java looks like in a Parallel Universe where upgrading to the latest Java doesn’t have to be a hassle, where stacktraces can be read and understood by human beings (that’s you!), and where dependency injection is never confusing.<br/>
I will show you a Parallel Universe where code is beautiful and simple.<br/>
I will show you a Parallel Universe where there is no magic.<br/>
I will show you a Parallel Universe where @Annotations were never invented.

Will you join me there?
